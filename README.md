# SpotifySpeedUp

A Python script to speed up the Windows Spotify desktop app.
My Spotify desktop app gets a lot of use. But over time, the app is incredibly slow on start up. It can be minutes before the app is responsive and ready to use. 
Based off info at https://community.spotify.com/t5/Desktop-Windows/Why-is-my-spotify-often-so-slow/td-p/703153, the Spotify cache is the culprit. I do not care if spotify has cache to make things pretty and personlized, multiple minute boot is unacceptable.
I used the solution on the Spotify forum and realized that it would be much easier to write software to do this automatically.

Run: python spotifySpeedUp.py
Platforms: Windows
